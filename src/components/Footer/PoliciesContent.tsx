            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>
              Website Visitors Landbook.com (‚ÄúLandbook‚Äù) is a platform that
              gathers and presents website design inspirations from all around
              the web to help Creative Professionals explore the latest design
              trends, get inspired by them and create their own unique work.
              Landbook does not own copyright to any website design presented on
              Landbook.com, nor is it responsible for content that appears
              within any website posted on Landbook.com. However, Landbook
              carefully selects websites which appear on the platform, making
              sure that no obscene, offensive or objectionable content is
              promoted. Below we present you Landbook‚Äôs policy to respect your
              privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
              our website. Privacy At Landbook we have a few fundamental
              principles regarding privacy: ‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt ask you for personal
              information unless we truly need it. ‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt share your
              personal information with anyone except to comply with the law,
              develop our products, or protect our rights. ‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt store
              personal information on our servers unless required for the
              on-going operation of one of our services. Website Visitors and
              Users Like most website operators, Landbook collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. Landbook‚Äôs purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              Landbook‚Äôs visitors use its website. From time to time, Landbook
              may release non-personally-identifying information in the
              aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
              its website. Landbook also collects potentially
              personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
              addresses. Landbook does not use such information to identify its
              visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other
              than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
              personally-identifying information, as described below. Gathering
              of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to Landbook
              websites choose to interact with Landbook in ways that require
              Landbook to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
              and type of information that Landbook gathers depends on the
              nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign
              up account at Landbook.com to provide a username and email
              address. Landbook collects such information only insofar as is
              necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors
              interaction with Landbook. Landbook does not disclose
              personally-identifying information other than as described below.
              And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
              information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
              engaging in certain website-related activities. Aggregated
              Statistics Landbook may collect statistics about the behavior of
              visitors to its websites. Landbook may display this information
              publicly or provide it to others. However, Landbook does not
              disclose personally-identifying information other than as
              described below. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying
              Information Landbook discloses potentially personally-identifying
              and personally-identifying information only to those of its
              employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need
              to know that information in order to process it on Landbook‚Äôs
              behalf or to provide services available at Landbook websites, and
              (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
              employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
              outside of your home country; by using Landbook‚Äôs websites, you
              consent to the transfer of such information to them.
